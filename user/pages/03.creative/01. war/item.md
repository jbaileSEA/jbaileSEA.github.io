On the edges of society, things get clear; there’s a contrast you get from living in motels, out of your car. Delineation gets easy and you realize what matters and what doesn’t. In those days, Summer was hot, hotter than it is today  wet and sweet, we’d slam into each other, drunk off the air around us.


Dave was drifting from the northeast, somewhere in Maine but he could never figure out exactly where. Every time we scraped a couple of dollars together and gorged on fast food, he’d tell us a new home, new stories about his family; he was antithetical to the concept of ‘having your shit together’ and I loved it and hated it. Our lives were ugly, deformed, natural and beautiful; waking up on a mattress in a junkie friend’s trap house and seeing her sitting across the room from me, hands on either side of her and a crack pipe in her mouth, I felt my skin crawl and the adrenaline evaporate off me in hot gasps. Her lips would cradle it, and the lighter kept moving from hand to hand as she puffed, and I saw the life in her eyes, distilled, pure, uncut. 


For all of us  but especially Dave  this was home: not a place, but a time. He was angry, always angry, a bundle of emotion in constant vibration. His favorite sound was the slap followed by the dull thud of a heavy fist against a jaw. It never mattered whose jaw it was, his or someone else’s. The fight was both the goal and the method. 


He drank deep of those hot Summer nights, his blood boiled in his veins and the pain of his life cried out into the night, begged for a catharsis clenched tight in a fist. There was no other way for him: he couldn’t hack it in art, and he was never comfortable outside of the climax of the battle. You could see it in his eyes when he threw his punches, sharp and piercing, too austere for such a molded and rotten world. It never mattered who he was placed at odds with: I saw him take on guys who dwarfed his frame, guys who could take everything the bursting sinew of his muscles had to give and then ask for more. I’d seen him take a man’s teeth out, one by one; they juxtaposed his own broken and crooked smile perfectly. Nothing about him was ever organized, and he fought just the same: wild, expressive, never thinking, only reacting to his world. 
	
In the six months we shared, I never saw him scared. The girl, Nancy one day and Dorothy tomorrow, who hung around him used to tell me that he had decided he was going to die and that no one could tell him otherwise; “Honestly”, with a joint between her lips and a couple of crack rocks in her pocket “he’s fucking insane, broke in the head. He’s so fucking alive, y’know? He’s beautiful.”. She’d keep saying, the stolen records bulging under her arms and with the life sapped out of her into a pipe and later a needle. Dave fought harder than I’d ever seen him before or since the night he got word she’d gone on with a bad shot in her left arm and a face emblazoned with shock. She had the same look we all had: wild and free and grasping for something that was real, something more; it was her forever goodbye.
	
For the rest of us, comfort came in a 40 oz bottle and the company of the other dregs. We were all living on the detritus of society, and we got by on what scant emotions we could scare up. Dave, though, Dave was mad with a capacity, a hunger, for more. Stooped over and with our feet in the gutter we’d look up and see him, wild and crazy and free, slamming his body into some poor sucker with all of his strength. He never ran, and he never quit until he felt his arms stopped by the grip of outsiders.

He never had an answer for me. Even when he was sitting in the emergency room with the side of his face shattered from a pry bar, his eye in danger, he would look at me and smile, blood pooling in the secret hollows of his mouth. I’d ask him why he did it, and he couldn’t ever tell me why: I guess it was a family thing. 

That part of my life closed with a bus ticket west and the promise of a steady job. I couldn’t hack it, and neither could anyone else in our circle but Dave. We’d all given up and limped, broken and whipped back into what portions of society we could find to hide in, hoping we’d go unnoticed. That morning Dave was shouting at the sun, two shots of meth in his thighs and his eyes bulging and wild. In all my years since, I’ve never met anyone as alive as he was in those six months.

Dave came back and forth through my life in the between, memories and half-remembered dreams and nightmares. Drifting in a lake of sweat I’d come out of it all and see him for a split-second sitting in the chair opposite my bed, his eyes sunk deep back into his head, staring out and challenging me, begging me. His eulogy captured in his features, I’d turn around and try to catch what little sleep I could, and in the final waking moments I’d wonder if I was giving up, if I was running.

His shadow bites at my heels, barking and screaming and driving me ever forwards, forcing me out of comfortable times and back onto the edges.
