Bodyworks, located in southern West Virginia, had a conundrum: how to transition their marketing away from a focus on occupational therapy and rehab to a more rounded client base. The operational plan was to expand into a 24 hour fitness center -- a completely open market in their small urban center -- and to market it to older millenial professionals. By moving from a per-service billing schema to one based around recurring subscriptions, ownership accounted for both an increase in gross revenue month-to-month and a decreased range of revenues.

Our plan was to use the allocated funds to hyper-target the clientele that ownership identified. In such a small locality, and with a niche audience, we knew that word of mouth would be a strong advantage to a coherent, managed campaign.

In deploying our plan, my team and I kept an eye on socialblade, along with Google Analytics. I found quickly that, when considering the new demographic Bodyworks was trying to reach, that their YouTube presence was nearly non-existent. From surveying existing members, we identified that as a strong opporutnity to extend the reach of the business; most older millenials spend their time exploring fitness options via video in lieu of text, and my client is uniquely positioned as the largest and most well-equipped facility in the area.

Our second meeting was focused on this opportunity. We produced three eight minute videos for internal use, demonstrating the format and method that would work with our demographic. Our templates were used by the internal team to produce short fitness videos, which drove traffic to both the client's social presence and their landing page.
